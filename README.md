# XY-Model
This code is for simulating the XY Model of spin lattice, where there are two dimensional spins on a 2D lattice surface. I tend to find the existence of 'vortex' on the final configuration of the relaxed system.

The Hamiltonian of the XY Model can be written as:

- J is the coupling constant
- θ is the angle of spins, with value between 0 and 2π

# Results
A 50*50 lattice is simulated, and its relaxed configuration shows 3 vortices.

The energy of the system decreases as more Monte Carlo sweeps are taken.
